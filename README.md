## Question 1

Markup Languages (ML) are systems that utilise sets of annotations such as tags and elements in a text document making it easier for computers to interpret and manipulate the text. These rules define and govern how elements such as text or images are presented digitally. There are many different types of Markup Languages, however some of the most common for web development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language) (Ben Sadok, 2021).

A major benefit of Markup Languages is improving Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) quality. HTML utilises semantic tags which define sections on a webpage which allows browsers, search engines and other developers to read and understand the flow of content easier (Ben Sadok, 2021). There are many different semantic tags that can be used and are generally divided for either Structure ie. `<header>, <main>, <section>` etc. or Text elements ie. `<h1> to <h6>, <p>` etc. By using semantic language, it adds an additional layer of information which makes the information more comprehensible and allows search engines to pinpoint crucial information on the webpage. This effectively assists in increasing the chances of a websites content to rank higher on the results page against the relevant keywords of the search. By implementing responsive design principles, it ensures websites are optimised depending on the device they are viewed on. This not only improves user experience by changing how websites are viewed on different sized screens, but also boosts SEO as Google now priortises results that are mobile-friendly. 

Additionally, Markup Languages enhance accessibility for users with disabilities making it easier to interact with websites, and simply more user-friendly for everyone. It enables assistive technologies such as screen readers, to interpret and output the information in ways the user requires to access it. An example of this would be using Alt Text for images with meaningful descriptions which lets screenreaders comprehend the context of an image and greatly increases the browsing experience for visually impaired users. By ensuring a website is highly assessible, it allows websites to reach wider audience which can be overlooked often. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have created Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which makes it easier for developers and designers to follow and produce an accessible website.

## Question 2

### Packets

A packet is a small unit or portion of data that is sent over a computer network. This method of splitting and sending data is known as Packet Switching. Each packet contains part of a complete message that hold important address information of the sending computer and its intended recipient, where the packets are then reordered into a single file at their destination. Packet loss occurs when one or more packets fail to reach the intended destination, resulting in information loss.

A network that facilitates packet is known as a Packet-Switching network. The worlds first Packet-Switching Network was developed in 1969 by Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense (ARPA) named ARPANET. This invention provided the foundation in which the internet still operates today. As ARPANET evolved, it required governance which supported the invention of a new method named Transmission-Control Protocol (TCP/IP) (ScienceMediaMuseum.org, 2020).

### IP Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

An Internet Protocol (IP) Address is a unique indentification number that is assigned to all devices connected to the internet. It is used for computers to efficiently communicate with each other over the internet or local networks to share information to specific locations. An IP Address has two parts, one of which identifies the host and the other the network is belongs to.

There are two core versions or standards of Internet Protocol, which are IP Version 4 and Version 6. IPv4 was first launched in 1981 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and later adopted by ARPANET in 1983. It still routes a majority of the internet traffic today and is a popular protocol for communication over the internet, however it's greatest limitation is that it can host just under 4.3 Billion possible IPv4 addresses due to 32-bit address format. This limitation is essentially solved by IPv6 as it uses a 128-bit address format which allows approximately 340 undecillion (2^128) possible IP addresses. Other improvements over IPv4 include autoconfiguration, routing and security upgrades. However, despite these improvements, the migration from IPv4 to v6 is expensive and complex, hence why most of the internet stills runs on IPv4 (geeksforgeeks.org, 2023). 

### Routers and Routing

Routing is the process of selecting the path in which the packets of information/data are transmitted across one or multiple networks (Rouse, 2023). These decisions are facilitated by devices known as routers. A router guides packets between two or more packet-switched networks. Its primary functions are to manage traffic between the networks and allowing multiple devices to utilise the same Internet Connection. Most routers today allow devices to connect to the internet wirelessly (Wifi).

### Domains and DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol for how computers relay data over the internet. It aids in converting user-friendly names which are easy to understand into an IP address which computers then use to identify on the network (Brain et al., 2024). It was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris and has been pivotal in shaping the internet as we know it today. DNS makes it easier for us as users to navigate websites with easy to remember names and eliminates the need for memorising individual IP addresses (Villanueva, 2021). Without a DNS translating the domain names to correct IP address, it would make it much more difficult to access the websites we want, especially if IP addresses were to change for whichever reason, DNS still allows us to view the page with the same domain name. 

## Question 3

### TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the internet protocol establishes a connection between computers, allowing them to communicate between each other by transferring data over long distances. As the internet is a packet-switched network, the data is broken down into small packets which are sent individually through different routes (facilitated by routers) and then reassembled at the destination (BasuMallick, 2022). Since it's inception in the 1970's-80's when the internet was being built, it has been a cornerstone in the development of communication over the internet. It provides a reliable method to transmit data over the internet, ensuring data is delivered accurately in its correct order (Kurose & Ross, 2021). Its design has effectively enabled it to scale with the current growth of the internet and served as a foundation for the advancing of many internet technologies (Severance, 2015). This has been accomplished by standardising the information delivery so all hosted applications on the internet are interoperable (BasuMallick, 2022).

### HTTP and HTTPS

### Web Browsers

## Question 4

Compilers (eg. C, C++) and Interpreters (eg. JS) are programs that take high-level language or source code, that we humans understand, and converts it into machine language; each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The main difference between the two is that, a compiler will read the entire code that is saved to a file before it is executed; whereas interpreters read source code line by line while the program is running (Ben Sassi, 2023). Compiled code generally takes longer to analyse than Interpreted as it goes through the entire code, but consequently the program will run faster than interpreted code being analysed line by line while the program is being executed. 

Compilers will display all errors after it's been compiled and interpreters will display the errors of each line individually which makes it simpler to debug. This in turn means that compilers generally consume more memory than interpreters. Another reason Compiled code is faster is due to it being optimised to the device or platform that is is run on, although this can also be a disadvantage as it means the programs may not be cross-platform compatible. Once code has been compiled, the executable file can be launched without needing any of the source code which provides some confidentiality. Interpreters always require the source code for processing but can be executed on any machine or device without compatibility issues (BasuMallick, 2023).

Both compilers and interpreters have unique applications and do not replace each other.
