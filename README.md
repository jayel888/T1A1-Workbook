## Question 1

Markup Languages (ML) are systems that utilise sets of annotations such as tags and elements in a text document making it easier for computers to interpret and manipulate the text. These rules define and govern how elements such as text or images are presented digitally. There are many different types of Markup Languages, however some of the most common for web development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language). (1)

A major benefit of Markup Languages is improving Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) quality. HTML utilises semantic tags which define sections on a webpage which allows browsers, search engines and other developers to read and understand the flow of content easier. There are many different semantic tags that can be used and are generally divided for either Structure ie. `<header>`, main, section etc. or Text elements ie. "h1 to h6, p etc. By using semantic language, it adds an additional layer of information which makes the information more comprehensible and allows search engines to pinpoint crucial information on the webpage. This effectively assists in increasing the chances of a websites content to rank higher on the results page against the relevant keywords of the search. 

Additionally, Markup Languages enhance accessibility for users with disabilities making it easier to interact with websites, and simply more user-friendly for everyone. It enables assistive technologies such as screen readers, to interpret and output the information in ways the user requires to access it. An example of this would be using Alt Text for images with meaningful descriptions which lets screenreaders comprehend the context of an image and greatly increases the browsing experience for visually impaired users. By ensuring a website is highly assessible, it allows websites to reach wider audience which can be overlooked often. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have created Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which makes it easier for developers and designers to follow and produce an accessible website.
