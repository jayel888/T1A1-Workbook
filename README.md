## Question 1

Markup Languages (ML) are systems that utilise sets of annotations such as tags and elements in a text document making it easier for computers to interpret and manipulate the text. These rules define and govern how elements such as text or images are presented digitally. There are many different types of Markup Languages, however some of the most common for web development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language). (1)

A major benefit of Markup Languages is improving Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) quality. HTML utilises semantic tags which define sections on a webpage which allows browsers, search engines and other developers to read and understand the flow of content easier. There are many different semantic tags that can be used and are generally divided for either Structure ie. `<header>, <main>, <section>` etc. or Text elements ie. `<h1> to <h6>, <p>` etc. By using semantic language, it adds an additional layer of information which makes the information more comprehensible and allows search engines to pinpoint crucial information on the webpage. This effectively assists in increasing the chances of a websites content to rank higher on the results page against the relevant keywords of the search. By implementing responsive design principles, it ensures websites are optimised depending on the device they are viewed on. This not only improves user experience by changing how websites are viewed on different sized screens, but also boosts SEO as Google now priortises results that are mobile-friendly. 

Additionally, Markup Languages enhance accessibility for users with disabilities making it easier to interact with websites, and simply more user-friendly for everyone. It enables assistive technologies such as screen readers, to interpret and output the information in ways the user requires to access it. An example of this would be using Alt Text for images with meaningful descriptions which lets screenreaders comprehend the context of an image and greatly increases the browsing experience for visually impaired users. By ensuring a website is highly assessible, it allows websites to reach wider audience which can be overlooked often. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have created Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which makes it easier for developers and designers to follow and produce an accessible website.

## Question 2

### Packets

A packet is a unit or portion of data that is sent over a computer network. This method of splitting and sending data is known as Packet Switching. Each packet contains part of a complete message that hold important address information of the sending computer and its intended recipient, where the packets are then reordered into a single file at their destination. Packet loss occurs when one or more packets fail to reach the intended destination.

The worlds first packet-switching network was developed in 1969 by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) named ARPANET. This invention provided the foundation in which the internet still operates today. As ARPANET evolved, it required governance which supported the invention of a new method named Transmission-Control Protocol (TCP/IP).
